# 5DoF-Robotic-Arm-Simulation
Modeling and trajectory planning of 5DoF Robotic Arm using Matlab and CoppeliaSim.

The 3D model of the arm is made using SolidWorks and from the 3D model URDF file in generated.
by linking matlab and CoppeliaSim using remoteApi coppeliasim is used to visualize the robot motion.
all the files are atteched below.
